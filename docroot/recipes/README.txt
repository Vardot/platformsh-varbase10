Recipes allow you apply configs and features to your Drupal site. You can use
themes contributed by others or create your own.

WHAT TO PLACE IN THIS DIRECTORY?
--------------------------------

Placing downloaded and custom recipes in this directory separates downloaded and
custom recipes from Drupal core's recipes. This allows Drupal core to be updated
without overwriting these files.

DOWNLOAD ADDITIONAL RECIPES
--------------------------

Contributed recipes from the Drupal community may be downloaded.
